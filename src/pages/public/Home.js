        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>CAPE supports members by coming together for meetings to discuss their own work and the issues they are facing. Professionals whose role is to provide advice and support to Designated leads in Schools are often doing so without supervision for themselves. Child protection work is difficult, complex and sensitive and CAPE aims to support members by meeting on a regular basis and through the member's forum.</p>
